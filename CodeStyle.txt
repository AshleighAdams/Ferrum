* Classes should represent well-defined objects. "Message", "Block" and "Octant" would make good classes. "Renderer", "*Manager", "*Handler" would not.
* Classes and structs should be named in upper camel case.
 
* Public methods and functions should be named in upper camel case.
* Public class fields should be named in lowercase with underscores delimiting words. ("blah_blah_blah") 
* Private class members should have an underscore prefix and should be in upper camel case.
* Local variables should be named in lowercase with underscores delimiting words.
* Variable names should not reflect their type, only their usage (private, class member, etc).
* The type of a variable should be specified completely before the variable except when not possible ("Type* var" is okay, "Type *var" is not)
* Global variables should only be used for caching. They should not store program state.
* The "this" keyword should be used explicitly whenever possible

* Header files should begin "#pragma once" and a header gaurd ("_H_HEADER_NAME") followed by the headers they reference followed by their declarations.
* External headers should be included before project headers.

* Tabs should be used for indentation, spaces may be used for alignment (if ever).
